# Streamlit Dashboard - Localization Projects
Built from real-world experience as a localization project manager in gaming, this dashboard provides actionable insights into translation workflows — tracking word count volumes, linguist distribution, vendor vs. in-house workload, and project trends across multiple game titles. 

Developed using Python, Streamlit, Pandas, Plotly, and Seaborn.

## 📁 Data
The dataset used in this project was cleaned and anonymized from internal localization data.
For confidentiality reasons, the raw CSV is not included in this repository.

To run the dashboard, place your own CSV file in the project root with the following columns:

- Game
- Request Type (Trans, LQA, Review)
- Total WC
- Assignee
